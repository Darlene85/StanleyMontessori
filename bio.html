                            absorbed knowledge from their surroundings, essentially teaching themselves."

                    <h1>Who is Maria Montessori?</h1>
                    <p>Maria Montessori was born on August 31, 1870. She was an Italian woman who advocated for women's rights
                        and mentally disabled children. Maria lived in an age where women were limited in their lifestyle
                        choices, but despite the culture at the time Maria made history.</p>
                    <p>In 1890 Maria graduated from an all boys technical school with a certificate in physic-mathematics. Then,
                        later graduated with honors as the first female medical student from the University of Rome. Maria
                        dedicated her time to studying medicine and surrounded herself in a world of pediatrics and psychiatry.
                        From 1896-1901, Maria studied phrenasthenic children and discovered a scientific pedagogy. She observed
                        and discovered how capable phrenasthenic children were able to concentrate. As a result, Maria created
                        materials that helped phrenasthenic children to learn and even perform at the same level academically
                        of non-phrenasthenic children. She continued to study, write articles and lecture.</p>
                    <p> In 1906, Maria was asked to work in San Lorenzo district, Rome. Where she was able to use her findings
                        with non-phrenasthenic children. Her first school was called Casa de Bambini. The methods she used
                        developed the whole child physically, socially, emotionally, and cognitively.</p>
                    <p>Maria's school gained attention and a second school was opened in 1907. Between 1909-1915, Maria Montessori's
                        method gained international recognition and development.</p>
